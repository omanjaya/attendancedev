# This is a placeholder for the notification sound file
# In a real implementation, you would place an actual MP3 audio file here
# For now, we'll create an empty file to prevent 404 errors

# You can download a notification sound from:
# - https://notificationsounds.com/
# - https://freesound.org/
# - Or record your own short notification sound

# The sound should be:
# - Short duration (1-3 seconds)
# - Pleasant and not jarring
# - Appropriate volume level
# - Clear audio quality
