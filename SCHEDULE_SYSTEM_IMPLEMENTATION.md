## 🔄 **Business Logic Implementation**

### **Schedule Assignment Process**
1. **Admin creates monthly schedule template** with working hours and location
2. **System generates daily schedule entries** for specified date range
3. **Admin assigns employees** using bulk assignment interface
4. **Holiday overrides applied** automatically for national holidays
5. **Teaching schedules imported** with attendance override logic
6. **System calculates final attendance rules** per employee per day

### **Attendance Calculation Rules**
```php
// Guru Honorer (Honorary Teachers)
if ($employee->employee_type === 'guru_honorer') {
    $teachingSchedule = $employee->getTeachingScheduleForDate($date);
    if ($teachingSchedule) {
        $expectedStart = $teachingSchedule->teaching_start_time;
        $workingHours = $teachingSchedule->duration_hours;
    }
}

// Guru Tetap (Permanent Teachers) & Staff
else {
    $baseSchedule = $employee->getBaseScheduleForDate($date);
    $expectedStart = $baseSchedule->start_time;
    $workingHours = $baseSchedule->working_hours;
}
```

### **Override Hierarchy**
1. **Base Monthly Schedule**: Default working hours for all employees
2. **Holiday Override**: National/regional holidays nullify work schedules
3. **Teaching Override**: Honorary teachers follow teaching hours only
4. **Manual Override**: Administrative adjustments take precedence

## 📊 **Database Schema Summary**

### **Core Tables**
- `monthly_schedules`: Schedule templates (5 columns + metadata)
- `employee_monthly_schedules`: Daily assignments (8 columns + override tracking)
- `national_holidays`: Holiday definitions (12 columns + recurrence config)
- `teaching_schedules`: Teaching periods (15 columns + substitute management)
- `holiday_locations`: Many-to-many holiday-location relationships

### **Key Relationships**
```
MonthlySchedule (1:N) EmployeeMonthlySchedule (N:1) Employee
NationalHoliday (N:M) Location via holiday_locations
TeachingSchedule (N:1) Employee (teacher)
TeachingSchedule (N:1) Subject
TeachingSchedule (N:1) AcademicClass
```
